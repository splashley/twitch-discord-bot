# My Twitch/Discord Bot (Still a work in progress)
Using the quick-chat-bot library and node.js, I created custom commands for my Twitch bot.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node.js, [quick-chat-bot](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quick-chat-bot)

## Lessons Learned:

I learned to use Fireebase for the first time with this project because I required a DB to store some data.
